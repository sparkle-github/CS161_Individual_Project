Python, Flask (tentative)

Algorithms/AI schemes used in the core engine:
Generating the puzzle: A matrix contains holes, numbered from 1 to 15, that form a triangle, starting with one hole in the first row and ending with 5 holes in the last row. 14 sticks are given to fill the holes leaving one empty spot.
The user can select any stick to jump over another stick and move to the adjacent empty hole, removing the stick over which jumping takes place. This is considered as one move. The user wins when only 1 stick is left in the triangle. 

Marketspace/ Selling point:
It is a tricky brain teaser and one can only win when played carefully with a strategy. 
It is a fun and interactive game to sharpen the mind.
